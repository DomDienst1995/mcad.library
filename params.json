Currently, the library includes the following classes:\r\n\r\n  - MCAD Pattern Scheduler\r\n  - MCAD Buffer Loader\r\n  - MCAD Utility Functions\r\n  - MCAD Rotary Widget\r\n  - MCAD Multi-Stage Envelope\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the library classes in your own projects, copy the .js file(s) of the classes you wish to use and include them as you would any other JavaScript file. For example, assuming the pattern scheduler .js file is in your project's root, you would use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"mcad.pattern.scheduler.v1-0.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further information as to how to use each class, please read the [documentation](http://drjferraris.github.io/mcad.library/doc/index.html) for each class.",
