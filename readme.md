# MCAD Web Audio Library 

The MCAD Web Audio Library provides a number of classes for performing common audio operations for web and mobile application development. Currently, the library includes the following classes:

  - MCAD Pattern Scheduler
  - MCAD Buffer Loader

### Usage

To use the library classes in your own projects, copy the .js file(s) of the classes you wish to use and include them as you would any other JavaScript file. For example, assuming the pattern scheduler .js file is in your project's root, you would use:

```
<script src="mcad.pattern.scheduler.v1-0.js"></script>
```

For further information as to how to use each class, please see the Tutorials section.
